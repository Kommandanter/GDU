 GER_ussr_war_goal_desc:0 "The German Armed Forces must be prepared, even before the conclusion of the war against England, to crush Soviet Russia in a rapid campaign ('Case Barbarossa'). It is of decisive importance that our intention to attack should not be known."

 GER_danzig_or_war_desc:0 "With the reunification of the German people nearly completed, the time has come to begin the acquisition of our rightful Lebensraum. The Danzig corridor, a German-majority area wrongfully given to Poland following the Great War, will provide a perfect pretext for invasion. The Western democracies claim they will stand behind Poland; they are likely bluffing, and if not? We shall crush them as well."

 france.20.t:0 "Defeated but not Finished"
 france.20.d:0 "The battle is lost. France has collapsed in the face of the German Wehrmacht, the back of the Third Republic that withstood the horrors of the Great War broken by the Blitzkrieg. A repulsive and weak puppet state set up in the town of Vichy grovels pathetically before Germany for mercy.\n\nAlthough France has lost the battle, it has not lost the war and the struggle carries on!  In the wake of the French armistice with Germany and establishment of a new government in Vichy France, a group of senior officers have rebelled against the so-called new French government. Charles de Gaulle has assumed leadership of this new Free French resistance, considering it his sacred duty to save the French people and nation, and to one day reclaim his homeland."
 france.20.a:0 "We'll be back!"
 news.60.d:0 "German troops have crossed into Bohemia and Moravia, ostensibly to restore order to the regions in the wake of the collapsing Czechoslovakian government. \n\nIn Prague, the occupying forces announced the creation of an 'autonomous protectorate' within the German Reich.\n\nWith German support, Slovakia has been "declared independent" under the leadership of Jozef Tiso. The nation of Czechoslovakia is no more."

With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph—so help us God. We go to destroy fascism, not only because we will it, but because we must!"
