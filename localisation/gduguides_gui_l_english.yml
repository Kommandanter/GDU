guides.1.t:0 "GDU Navy1; Poisitioning"
guides.1.d:0 "Positioning is basically a value that starts to give your navy debuffs when it drops bellow 100 \n \n  In GDU at 0 positioning you get following debuffs; -70% air attack, -30% screening, -60% naval attack   \n  \n  in GDU it is set so that when your fleet is say 50% bigger than the enemy fleet ( 300vs 200 ships) you do not get any positioning penalties, assuming you have an admiral assigned,  but as battle goes on, and say your fleet becomes 150% bigger than the enemy fleet, (example 2 to 5 ship ration, 200 vs 500 ships) you do get the maximum positioning penalty of 100% and have 0 positioning and get the maximum penalty.   \n  \n  to put it to end, Your positioning will scale between 0%( at 2.5/1.0 and above) and 100%(at 1.5/1.0 ratio and bellow) depending on ship ratio of sides , if you want to hear how it's made, it is done by giving all admirals +50% base positioning and playing with positioning values in 00_defines.lua "

guides.2.t:0 "GDU Army1; Piercing"
guides.2.d:0 "Piercing is basically a value and if it exceeds your enemy's Armor, you get no penalties, and your enemy get no bonusses   \n \n  in vanilla, a division's piercing is basicallly 60% of division's average piercing + 40% of battalion with highest piercing, and for armor it is 70% of division's average armor + 30% of battalion with highest armor  \n  \n  in GDU it is set so that your division's piercing is 100% of the battalion with highest piercing!, meaning if you have a HTD in your division, division's piercing will be HTD's piercing, but beware, you are not allowed mix non foot units with foot units so you cant put a HTD to your infantry battalion \n  \n  In GDU Anti tank have very high hard attack for it's cost. but it is never going to pierce the enemy ,  \n  \n  When you do not get pierced, you take 50% less damage, when you do pierce enemy you deal extra damage, and very high amount of extra organization damage,  This means that AT  will not get the "very high organization "  damage bonus , will mostly lose combat to tanks, but will stil in terms of equipemnt IC , trade very favouribly againist tanks. "

guides.3.t:0 "GDU Air1; CAS"
guides.3.d:0 "CAS in GDU is very , very special. In vanilla there is a point where if your air superiorty is above it, your cas works and you get air support 35% stat bonus, while your enemy lose the 35% air support stat bonus, on top of your cas starting to do actual damage and enemy's cas stopping \n \n  And GDU fixes this problem, in GDU you can safely " assuming you got atleast equal amount of fighters" CAS your enemy while also getting CAS'd  even in say 4k vs 10k planes scenario   \n  \n Is not it great??? so this mod is not a CAS mod   \n  \n  Compared to vanilla, in gdu, Cas also do less direct damage, but still provide fair stat bonusses, so you cant cas with pure inf and kill ppl, Cas dont get mass shotdown by AA, and thats all, i suggest you to also read the Reverse Gangbang guide"

guides.4.t:0 "GDU Air2; (Reverse)Gangbang effect"
guides.4.d:0 "OH NO AIR IS RED, RIP  \n \n  Fear not! in GDU you no longer get a massive air casualties, compared to your enemy , from having less planes flying in the zone  \n  \n It could even be said that gangbang is now reversed and you get very little positive K/D ratios when you use less planes "
guides.4.a:0 "Thanks for the information."

guides.5.t:0 "GDU Army2; Very Basic Division Template Tips"
guides.5.d:0 "Firstly, divisions bellow 20w are not allowed, in GDU division templates you make are far diffrent than in vanilla, due to fact that AT, ART, AA, Rifles have their attack, defence, breakthroguh, supply statistics changed a lot  \n \n  In GDU it is a must to have a single AA( one aa in gdu is 2 width) in every single division, Having AA prevents you from being over run easily , reduces effects of air superiorty  and reduces direct damage of enemy cas by 60%  \n \n  In GDU, ART, AT, AA all have good stats, and are actually either as supply efficient as infantry, or even more.  in GDU, NEVER EVER MAKE PURE INFANTRY, rifles have their stats spread among other equipment and other equipment are made cheaper while rifles are more expensive, rifles are basically some defense and HP, nothing more in GDU \n  \n  in GDU, Damage vs brk-defense is far higher than in vanilla, due to this factor, combat is bit faster , so you want to most of the time have Signals on most of your front line-- combat divisions assuming they are made to have reserves-- reinforce in important battles etc. else does not matter if you got 8  40 wdivs or 2 in a tile, a quality division will easily push them at same time \n  \n  as Last, support companies are cheaper, and you can greatly improve quality of your army by making sure all your divisions including reserves have full support companies regardless of doctrine , ( as long as ur not using them to break infra)  "

guides.6.t:0 " GDU Air Tips for Beginners "
guides.6.d:0 "1- Transport planes are useful for providing supply to your troops in this mod , but they are expensive \n \n  2- While playing as air controller, you should put your Fighters to airfields where they will have best air coverage, over putting them to say border with enemy. \n \n  3- Make sure your air wings with aces on them are operating from best airfields \n \n  4- In GDU , you train everything faster during early game, so you may wanna due to attrition and fuel reasons train your planes early \n \n  5- There is no air gangbang, dont be afraid of trading air with your enemy \n \n  6- It is not suggested to upgrade reliablity on your planes \n \n  7- Tactical Bombers have good range, but unlike cas , they do get disrupted in gdu often, due to not having mach 2 speed \n \n  8- State AA is a hard counter to bombers in GDU \n \n  9- It is strictly suggested to have atleast 1/5 fighter to cas ratio production in gdu, since Cas can join even in red air \n \n  10- Diffrence between interception and air superiorty is , interception use 1/5 fuel, but dont provide air superiorty, but still disrupt planes as if regularly flying "
