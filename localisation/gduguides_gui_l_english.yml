guides.1.t:0 "GDU Navy1; Poisitioning"
guides.1.d:0 "Positioning is basically a value that starts to give your navy debuffs when it drops bellow 100 \n \n  In GDU at 0 positioning you get following debuffs; -70% air attack, -30% screening, -60% naval attack   \n  \n  in GDU it is set so that when your fleet is say 50% bigger than the enemy fleet ( 300vs 200 ships) you do not get any positioning penalties, assuming you have an admiral assigned,  but as battle goes on, and say your fleet becomes 150% bigger than the enemy fleet, (example 2 to 5 ship ration, 200 vs 500 ships) you do get the maximum positioning penalty of 100% and have 0 positioning and get the maximum penalty.   \n  \n  to put it to end, Your positioning will scale between 0%( at 2.5/1.0 and above) and 100%(at 1.5/1.0 ratio and bellow) depending on ship ratio of sides , if you want to hear how it's made, it is done by giving all admirals +50% base positioning and playing with positioning values in 00_defines.lua "

guides.2.t:0 "GDU Army1; Piercing"
guides.2.d:0 "Piercing is basically a value and if it exceeds your enemy's Armor, you get no penalties, and your enemy get no bonusses   \n \n  in vanilla, a division's piercing is basicallly 60% of division's average piercing + 40% of battalion with highest piercing, and for armor it is 70% of division's average armor + 30% of battalion with highest armor  \n  \n  in GDU it is set so that your division's piercing is 100% of the battalion with highest piercing!, meaning if you have a HTD in your division, division's piercing will be HTD's piercing, but beware, you are not allowed mix non foot units with foot units so you cant put a HTD to your infantry battalion \n  \n  In GDU Anti tank have very high hard attack for it's cost. but it is never going to pierce the enemy ,  \n  \n  When you do not get pierced, you take 50% less damage, when you do pierce enemy you deal extra damage, and very high amount of extra organization damage,  This means that AT  will not get the "very high organization "  damage bonus , will mostly lose combat to tanks, but will stil in terms of equipemnt IC , trade very favouribly againist tanks. "

guides.3.t:0 "GDU Air1; CAS"
guides.3.d:0 "CAS in GDU is very , very special. In vanilla there is a point where if your air superiorty is above it, your cas works and you get air support 35% stat bonus, while your enemy lose the 35% air support stat bonus, on top of your cas starting to do actual damage and enemy's cas stopping \n \n  And GDU fixes this problem, in GDU you can safely " assuming you got atleast equal amount of fighters" CAS your enemy while also getting CAS'd  even in say 4k vs 10k planes scenario   \n  \n Is not it great??? so this mod is not a CAS mod   \n  \n  Compared to vanilla, in gdu, Cas also do less direct damage, but still provide fair stat bonusses, so you cant cas with pure inf and kill ppl, Cas dont get mass shotdown by AA, and thats all, i suggest you to also read the Reverse Gangbang guide"

guides.4.t:0 "GDU Air2; (Reverse)Gangbang effect"
guides.4.d:0 "OH NO AIR IS RED, RIP  \n \n  Fear not! in GDU you no longer get a massive air casualties, compared to your enemy , from having less planes flying in the zone  \n  \n It could even be said that gangbang is now reversed and you get very little positive K/D ratios when you use less planes "

guides.5.t:0 "GDU Army2; Very Basic Division Template Tips"
guides.5.d:0 "Firstly, divisions bellow 20w are not allowed, in GDU division templates you make are far diffrent than in vanilla, due to fact that AT, ART, AA, Rifles have their attack, defence, breakthroguh, supply statistics changed a lot  \n \n  In GDU it is a must to have a single AA( one aa in gdu is 2 width) in every single division, Having AA prevents you from being over run easily , reduces effects of air superiorty  and reduces direct damage of enemy cas by 60%  \n \n  In GDU, ART, AT, AA all have good stats, and are actually either as supply efficient as infantry, or even more.  in GDU, NEVER EVER MAKE PURE INFANTRY, rifles have their stats spread among other equipment and other equipment are made cheaper while rifles are more expensive, rifles are basically some defense and HP, nothing more in GDU \n  \n  in GDU, Damage vs brk-defense is far higher than in vanilla, due to this factor, combat is bit faster , so you want to most of the time have Signals on most of your front line-- combat divisions assuming they are made to have reserves-- reinforce in important battles etc. else does not matter if you got 8  40 wdivs or 2 in a tile, a quality division will easily push them at same time \n  \n  as Last, support companies are cheaper, and you can greatly improve quality of your army by making sure all your divisions including reserves have full support companies regardless of doctrine , ( as long as ur not using them to break infra)  "

guides.6.t:0 " GDU Air Tips for Beginners "
guides.6.d:0 "1- Transport planes are useful for providing supply to your troops in this mod , but they are expensive \n \n  2- While playing as air controller, you should put your Fighters to airfields where they will have best air coverage, over putting them to say border with enemy. \n \n  3- Make sure your air wings with aces on them are operating from best airfields \n \n  4- In GDU , you train everything faster during early game, so you may wanna due to attrition and fuel reasons train your planes early \n \n  5- There is no air gangbang, dont be afraid of trading air with your enemy \n \n  6- It is not suggested to upgrade reliablity on your planes \n \n  7- Tactical Bombers have good range, but unlike cas , they do get disrupted in gdu often, due to not having mach 2 speed \n \n  8- State AA is a hard counter to bombers in GDU \n \n  9- It is strictly suggested to have atleast 1/5 fighter to cas ratio production in gdu, since Cas can join even in red air \n \n  10- Diffrence between interception and air superiorty is , interception use 1/5 fuel, but dont provide air superiorty, but still disrupt planes as if regularly flying "

guides.7.t:0 " GDU Naval Compositions "
guides.7.d:0 " This guide is written for beginners In gdu if you read the positioning guide, you already know that your positioning scales between 100 and 0 as your fleet size compared to enemy grows from 1.5 to 2.5 , and in gdu lower positioning is always lower damage \n \n So dont this createa permanent downsizing of fleets? Answer is no for 2 reasons, Carriers, and after being 2.5 size the enemy since your positioning cant go bellow 0,  \n \n in GDU it is must to have 4 carriers due to how strong they are, and to screen those carriers and reduce chance of them being hit by other carriers it is must to have 8-10 capitals and to screen all your 10-11 capitals from strong torpedos that are made stronger againist bbs specifically, you need screens. around 50-60 of them   \n \n Another reason why smaller fleet is not always better is simply if you use say 10 ships in a task force, sure your enemy will have 0 positioning, but if you fight 25 ships you will be at your peak, at 50 ships , well say good bye to your ships  \n \n Thats it for the composition guide, screen your carrier, screen your bb, but dont spam ships , positioning kills."

guides.8.t:0 " GDU Naval Tips for Beginners "
guides.8.d:0 "1- In GDU a fleet going to repair is very hard to detect, so dont panic  \n \n  2-In GDU, ships retreat faster(based on speed), what this means is if you dont set your ships to never repair-always engage most of your fleet will escape damaged. \n \n 3-Convoy raider has the advantage of giving enemy a positioning debuff from defender's positioning going down due to added number of convoys \n \n 4- GDU Torpedos do double damage to capitals, but are bit weaker than in vanilla againist other ships(achieved with surface visbility-armor change)  \n \n  5- The Naval Armor damage reduction formula is (1-(piercing/armor)) \n \n 6- In GDU , carriers are powerful but it is still not suggested to have more than 4-5 in your task force \n \n 7-In GDU, CAs have added surface visbility, making them really bad, and also refits are cheap, it is suggested to even take their batteries out and use them as CLs \n \n 8- Refits are really cheap, cheapt to a degree where you make a naked ship and add equipment later for no additional cost, ( i dont like it but whatever ) \n \n 9 - You can increase amount of docks you have assigned to ship repair, split your fleet and send them to diffrent ports to repair faster \n \n 10 - Only use Carrier navs, They are undisruptable in the mod(and also vanilla i think?) unless you use bigger than 100 sized air wings which is banned"

guides.9.a:0 "Thanks for the Information "

guides.10.t:0 "Extreme Summary of GDU "
guides.10.d:0 "1- GDU AIR ; State of ART Cas and Fighters, it is set so that everyone builds some air, but no matter what you do, you can not completely disrupt your enemy's CAS, and you dont trade better by just having more planes, and AA dont mass shot down cas but do a fair damge reduction, While fighters kill cas and fight fighters so Always have CAS, AA and some fighters \n \n 2- GDU LAND; AT= lose battle wins IC Trade Always,  Never pierces Tanks but do good STR damage but low org damage, AA= Must but not broken , Support companies = Super Cheap fill all slots ART=If you have no line ART, you are playing this mod very wrong, it is more supply efficient than inf and have almost same ic cost per width and good stats \n \n 3- GDU NAVY; No doomstacking, you make Carrier centered battlegroups, no single decisive battle but a sort of war of attrition, Dont forget to refit, and make naked ships, always have admiral,  "

guides.11.t:0 "Dont Do These Mistakes "
guides.11.d:0 "1-Do not go to front line with encryption research and logistics support companies,if you dont, you will kill your allies, \n \n 2- Do not attack in Eastern Front winter and Mud as Axis, due to your terrible acclimitization compared to sov and it actually mattering in the mod \n \n 3- Do not tech rush as a minor nation in this mod. in this mod ahead of time penalty is much higher Just do your industry focuses first ALWAYS \n \n 4- Do not use Tanks with no fuel, you can see if your tank has fuel by looking at barrel icon next to it in army division list. \n \n 5- Always go for the better economy law when available \n \n 6- Dont make pure infantry \n \n 7- Do not doomstack your navy , do not d-day germany-- paradrop hungary doing so gives germany total war, instead go invade italy that does not trigger it \n \n 8-Do not fight without CAS, air color do not matter much in this mod \n \n 9- Have maintenance companies and high reliablity if you are going to fight in Desert-Easternfront-Pacific, makes a massive diffrence \n \n 10- Do not forget to ask your major nation what to do, always coordinate   "
