GDU_WS_FIN_desc:0 "\n\nThe §YRepublic of Finland§! has been an independent nation for nearly two decades, but recent developments in the world point to our independence once more soon being threatened. We might not be as large as other nations or have as much manpower, but we have the best weapon on our side: The undying determination and bravery of our people to defend their land at any cost.\n\nFinland is a member of the Axis powers, but not quite in the same way as most. Your focus is primarily on the £cominternSoviet Union, and in most cases the only conflict you have will be with Stalin and his hordes--Not the Allies.  You are not allowed to justify wargoals against anyone, and may not join World War II against the Allies unless they attack you first.\n\nOnce the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is signed sometime in 1939 and Germany goes to war, you will be attacked by the Soviets. No one will help you. Don't worry, though! You are more than a match for the Soviets due to a hefty Officers Purged modifier that makes his army terrible along with your Sisu National Spirit, making you potent in your own land. He's not allowed to annex you and will only take Karjala and Salla. Still, this can be a good opportunity to fight and damage the Soviets if you prepare properly, draining their equipment and making them more vulnerable later in the game. Be careful to avoid getting encircled, and guard your ports against naval invasions.\n\nAfter the Winter War, you can rest and recuperate. Once Germany invades the Soviet Union, your objective is to help them as best you can by taking the city of Leningrad. While the Soviet Union is large, your troops are better than theirs will ever be and he is bound to be distracted fighting the rest of the Axis. You win by capitulating the Soviet Union and helping the Axis achieve victory."
GDU_WS_FIN_build:0 "§YFinland§! may look weak, but packs a punch far above its weight class when played properly.\n\nWhen it comes to your focus tree, focus on economy first. Get your bonuses for civilian and military factories and the research slot along with consumer goods. Conserve bonuses to get strong equipment; Rocket Artillery, Anti Tank II, or even Artillery III and Guns III are within reach by 1941 and can really help you out.\n\nKeep building civilain factories until perhaps 1938. You could build until 1939, but you won't cause any harm in the winter war.\n\nStrong bonuses in your national focus tree to infantry favor an infantry playstyle; try building Jaegers, a special forces unit that is good in Forests. Follow the template suggestions.\n\nYou have two wars to fight, and there's different needs for both.\n\nThe §YWinter War§! is a defensive war, aided by your Sisu national spirit. The Soviet Union is likely to attack you with planes and outdated tanks in mid to late 1939. Karjala is likely to be where they strike, along the plains tiles. Make sure to fill these with quality infantry divisions filled with at least two line anti air to mitigate the inevitable loss of air superiority you'll experience.\n\nThe §YContinuation War§! is an aggressive war that coincides with Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union. Your objective for this war is to take Leningrad. Shock troops can really help here, as Leningrad is multiple urban tiles.  You're going to lose lots of men; keep attacking from multiple directions, tile by tile, and you just might crack through."
